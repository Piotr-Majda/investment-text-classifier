# Machine Learning and Neural Networks

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

**Core purpose of machine learning:**

- Automatically discover patterns in data
- Use these patterns to predict future data or make decisions
- Improve performance with experience/more data
- Handle tasks that are too complex for traditional programming

### Types of Machine Learning

#### 1. Supervised Learning

- Learns from labeled examples (input â†’ correct output)
- Goal: Predict outputs for new, unseen inputs
- **Common applications**: Classification, regression, forecasting
- **Examples in finance**: Credit scoring, stock price prediction, fraud detection

#### 2. Unsupervised Learning

- Works with unlabeled data
- Goal: Find structure, patterns, or relationships in data
- **Common applications**: Clustering, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection
- **Examples in finance**: Customer segmentation, portfolio diversification, market structure analysis

#### 3. Reinforcement Learning

- Agent learns by interacting with an environment
- Goal: Learn a policy that maximizes cumulative rewards
- **Common applications**: Game playing, robotics, resource management
- **Examples in finance**: Algorithmic trading, portfolio optimization

### Common Machine Learning Algorithms

#### Classification Algorithms

- **Logistic Regression**: Simple linear model for binary/multi-class classification
- **Decision Trees**: Flowchart-like structure for decisions based on feature values
- **Random Forests**: Ensemble of decision trees for improved accuracy and robustness
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Finds optimal boundary between classes
- **Naive Bayes**: Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Classifies based on majority vote of nearest neighbors

#### Regression Algorithms

- **Linear Regression**: Models linear relationship between dependent and independent variables
- **Polynomial Regression**: Extension of linear regression for non-linear relationships
- **Ridge/Lasso Regression**: Linear regression with regularization to prevent overfitting
- **Decision Tree Regression**: Uses decision trees for predicting continuous values
- **Gradient Boosting**: Ensemble technique building trees sequentially to correct errors

#### Clustering Algorithms

- **K-Means**: Partitions data into K clusters based on feature similarity
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Builds nested clusters by merging or splitting
- **DBSCAN**: Density-based clustering for finding arbitrary-shaped clusters

#### Dimensionality Reduction

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduces dimensions while preserving variance
- **t-SNE**: Visualizes high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D space
- **Autoencoders**: Neural networks that compress then reconstruct data

#### Sequence Models

- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: Process sequential data with memory
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: Special RNN that addresses vanishing gradient problem
- **Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)**: Simplified version of LSTM with fewer parameters

### Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Problem Definition**: Define the task and success metrics
2. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant data for the task
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, normalize, and transform data
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features from raw data
5. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate algorithm(s) for the task
6. **Model Training**: Fit the model to the training data
7. **Model Evaluation**: Assess performance on validation data
8. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters
9. **Model Deployment**: Implement the model in production
10. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Track performance and retrain as needed

### Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning

- **Machine Learning**: Broader field encompassing many algorithms and approaches
- **Deep Learning**: Subset of ML focusing on neural networks with multiple layers
  - Excels at learning hierarchical features from data
  - Often outperforms traditional ML for unstructured data (images, text, audio)
  - Requires more data and computational resources
  - Less interpretable than some traditional ML models

Our investment text classifier uses deep learning (specifically transformers) because of its superior ability to understand the nuances and contextual relationships in text data.

# Understanding Neural Networks

This document provides an overview of neural networks, how they work, and their application in our investment text classifier.

## What is a Neural Network?

A neural network is a computational model inspired by the human brain's structure and function. These networks are designed to recognize patterns in data through a process resembling how human neurons process information.

**Key characteristics:**

- Composed of interconnected processing nodes (neurons)
- Learn from examples rather than being explicitly programmed
- Improve performance over time through training
- Excel at finding patterns in complex, high-dimensional data

## Neural Network Layers

Neural networks are organized in layers of neurons. Each layer performs specific transformations on the data:

### 1. Input Layer

- Receives the raw data (in our model, tokenized investment text)
- Doesn't perform computations, just passes data to the next layer
- For text data, this often represents numerical token IDs

### 2. Hidden Layers

Our investment text classifier uses DistilBERT, which contains multiple sophisticated hidden layers:

#### Embedding Layers

- Convert token IDs into dense vectors (typically 768 dimensions for DistilBERT)
- Capture semantic meaning of words
- Similar words have similar embeddings in the vector space

#### Transformer Layers

- **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Helps the model understand relationships between words in context
  - Example: In "Buy tech stocks with strong growth," attention helps link "strong" with "growth"
  - Each word attends to all other words with different weights
- **Feed-Forward Networks**: Process the outputs of attention
  - Apply non-linear transformations
  - Learn complex patterns in the data
- **Layer Normalization**: Stabilizes the learning process
  - Normalizes the activations to prevent extreme values
  - Helps the model train faster and more reliably

### 3. Output Layers

Our model has three specialized output layers (called "heads"):

- **Risk Level Classifier**: 3 neurons (high/medium/low)
- **Investment Horizon Classifier**: 3 neurons (short/medium/long-term)
- **Action Classifier**: 4 neurons (buy/sell/hold/ignore)

Each output neuron produces a score, and the highest score in each category represents the model's prediction.

## How Information Flows Through a Neural Network

1. **Input Processing**: Text tokens enter the network
2. **Forward Propagation**: Each layer transforms the data by:
   - Multiplying inputs by weights
   - Adding biases
   - Applying activation functions (e.g., ReLU, GELU, or sigmoid)
3. **Feature Extraction**: Hidden layers extract increasingly abstract features
   - Early layers: basic patterns
   - Deeper layers: complex concepts
4. **Output Generation**: Final layers produce probability scores for each class

## The Learning Process

Neural networks learn through a process called training:

1. **Initialization**: The model starts with random weights
2. **Forward Pass**: The model makes predictions on training data
3. **Loss Calculation**: Predictions are compared to correct answers using a loss function
   - In our model, we use Cross-Entropy Loss for each classification task
4. **Backpropagation**: The error is propagated backward through the network
5. **Weight Updates**: The model's parameters are adjusted to reduce errors
   - Our model uses the AdamW optimizer, which adapts learning rates for different parameters
6. **Iteration**: Steps 2-5 repeat for multiple epochs until performance stops improving

## Multi-Task Learning

Our investment text classifier employs multi-task learning, where a single model learns to perform multiple related tasks simultaneously:

- Shares a common representation (the transformer layers)
- Has task-specific output layers
- Benefits from knowledge transfer between tasks
- Typically results in better generalization than separate models

## Transformer Architecture

The transformer architecture used in our model has several advantages over traditional RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks):

- **Parallelization**: Can process all tokens simultaneously
- **Long-range Dependencies**: Better captures relationships between distant words
- **Pre-training**: Leverages knowledge from massive text corpora
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Focuses on relevant parts of the input

## Practical Considerations

When working with neural networks like the one in our investment text classifier:

- **Training Data**: More diverse and representative data generally leads to better performance
- **Hyperparameters**: Learning rate, batch size, and model size affect training dynamics
- **Overfitting**: Too much specialization on training data can hurt generalization
- **Evaluation**: Always validate on separate data to ensure real-world performance
